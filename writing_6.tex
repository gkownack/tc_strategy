\section{Approach}
The objective of this project was to build a turn-based strategy game with shifting-scale battles.
Our four main goals were to make the game fun, challenging, strategic, and simple to play from a user interface perspective.
Overall, we failed these goals.
We created a playable strategy game with large-scale and small-scale battles that two people can play on a single computer.
Without an AI for the single-player
