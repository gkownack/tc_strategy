So I guess Billy and Philip know how to Git, so this is mainly for Jonathan.
Whenever you start working for the day, you should run "git pull".
This pulls any changes that other group membered pushed into the repository.
From there, you can start working.

If you create a new file, add it using "git add filename.ext".
This won't actually add it to the repository, though. Once you do this, you
will need to run "git commit -m 'Useful message about things you did'". Even
then, this isn't enough. You finally run "git push" to push everything online
to the rest of the group.

If you edit a file, you can either add it and commit it as above, or you can
run "git commit -a -m 'Message'". The "-a" flag says to commit all changes.
This only works on files which have already been added at least one.

Yaaaay git.

git milk.
